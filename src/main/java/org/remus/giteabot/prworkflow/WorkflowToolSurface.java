/**
 * The tool surface one PR-workflow run offers its agent: the workflow's own tools, plus — of the
 * read-only catalogue tools a workflow run adds, {@code execute-code} among them — only the ones
 * the bot's own tool configuration selects. A workflow run therefore honours the selection exactly
 * as the coding, writer and agent-review runs do: an operator who removed {@code rg} or never opted
 * into {@code execute-code} does not get it back here.
 *
 * <p>Before this class a workflow's agent advertised only its own workflow tools and handed
 * every returned name to its own executor, so no catalogue tool reached those runs at all — not the
 * repository reads, not {@code execute-code}. The tool carries
 * {@link ToolCatalog.Role#PR_WORKFLOW}, but nothing on that surface offered or dispatched it, so the
 * role entry was dead. This surface closes the gap: {@link #advertised()} returns the workflow's own
 * descriptors together with the read-only ones, and {@link #executeRouted} dispatches a catalogue
 * name the workflow does not own to an {@link AgentToolRouter} in {@link AgentToolRouter.Mode#WRITER}
 * — the same read-only handler the writer and agent-review runs use, so the two-way split in the
 * runner is the only new dispatch logic.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code router} is {@code null} on a path with no router wired (unit tests that build an agent
 * without one, and {@code AgentToolRouter}'s own convention): the run then advertises only the
 * workflow's own tools and refuses a catalogue name with an explanation instead of failing
 * obscurely.</p>
